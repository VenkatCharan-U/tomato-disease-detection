Tomato Disease Detection using AI

An AI-powered web application that detects tomato leaf diseases using Deep Learning.
Users can upload an image of a tomato leaf, and the system predicts the disease along with confidence score in real time.

 Project Overview

Tomato crops are highly vulnerable to various diseases that reduce yield and quality. Early detection helps farmers take preventive measures quickly.
This project uses a trained Deep Learning model integrated with a FastAPI backend and a modern frontend interface to provide instant disease prediction.
